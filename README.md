## a-go-go

Not much to [see](http://johanlindberg.github.io/a-go-go/) here folks. Keep moving.

_NOTE!_ If you have happened to stumble across this repo before you will notice that
I've wiped it. I'm switching my development environment from ChromeOS to Linux and
unfortunately the git implementation in the Chrome Dev Editor isn't playing nice.
Plus I really want to restructure the whole thing.
